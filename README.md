# FanartViewer
- By Boozel

# Use; READ THIS

- Fanart Viewer will immediately open a file select dialogue the first time you launch it. Point this dialogue to the folder that contains all of your artist folders.

- The required directory layout to function is as follows:

	- Container folder (point the file select here)
		+ artist_name1
			+ artist_image1.png
			+ artist_image2.png
		+ artist_name2
			+ artist_image1.png
			+ artist_image2.png
		+ etc.
	
# User Options and Shortcuts:
	- CTRL+H
		+ Show/Hide the settings ribbon
	- CTRL+Y
		+ Run initial setup again (allows you to change art directories)
	- CTRL+C
		+ Change background color matte (the 'green screen')
	- CTRL+S
		+ Change the size of Fanart Viewer using text entry (The window can be resized with click and drag without using this context)
	- CTRL+T
		+ Set the timer that dictates how long to linger on each image. Default is 5000 (5 seconds). Value entry is in milliseconds.

Note that the shortcuts other than showing/hiding the settings ribbon will not work when the ribbon is hidden.
