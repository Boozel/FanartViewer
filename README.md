# Use FUCKIN READ THIS

- This has like, no validation. If you mess it up, it WILL RUN UNTIL YOU KILL IT via TaskManager

- Before you THINK about running it fill the 'pictures' folder with images like so:

   + Folder names as the artist's credit (e.g. '@JeffBezos')

   + Inside of an artist's folder, place all of their art

# TODO:
- Validation to prevent hanging
- Custom draw for a label object so we can get text with an outline
- Configurable settings (set TLD for images, set image rotation speed)
